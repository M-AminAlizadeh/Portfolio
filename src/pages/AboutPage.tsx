        Hello, I'm Amin Alizadeh, a Full-stack Web Developer with a strong
        passion for turning creative ideas into functional and visually
        appealing digital solutions. I'm a Computer engineering graduate who
        learned a lot about Problem-solving solutions then I joined an
        international coding Bootcamp to Learn how to work as a team,
        collaborate with other developers, and sharpen my skills in technical
        aspects plus learn how to use soft skills in the working environment in
        the tech industry. I accomplished work on nearly +20 projects during
        this time. I'm committed to clean code, scalability, and constant
        improvement. I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork to
        create exceptional digital experiences.

        I've had the privilege of working as a freelancer on Fiverr, where I've
        had the opportunity to collaborate with clients from around the globe.
        My next goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in
        web development. I'm eager to take on challenging projects that demand
        innovation, creativity, and a keen eye for detail.

        In my free time, I read books mostly about biography, sometimes walking
        outside and watching documentaries.
